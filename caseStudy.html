		<h1>CASE STUDY</h1>
			<p>Like many of us my partner, Monica, and I had came across a point in our lives where we had to find a room mate.Upon reminiscing on this experience, we realized we had a little voice on the back of our heads that made us wonder if we were going to develop a friendship with this stranger that we know little to nothing about. but somehow happens to work in the same area and possibly have a compatible personality that has the potential to turn into a close relationship.</p>


		<h1>PROBLEM/WHY?</h1>
			<p>The initial problem my partner and I found when it came to room mate finder applications is that they weren’t the best when it came to user experience. They only had one featiure*/

			When looking for roommates via applications, we found that it only allowed users to make superficial connections through their web app. Thus, making us difficult to assure ourselves /*to *wonder*/ if we would really want to live with this person. And this is the main reason why monica and I decide to build EasyLiving. For those who want to build a deeper connection with people that they want to room with. From being strangers to possibly close friends. 

			Beside this concept, another problem with this kind of application is that they have poor user experience. The visual aspect of the application seems to be made in the early-mid 2000’s and it was basically a page filled with emails and a small description of the place.Also, I'm pretty sure I’m not the only one who thinks that alert boxes are annoying!So my partner and I decided when it came to creating this application that
			1) we wanted to make the annoyance meter for the user was at 0, whether it be while using the application or any occurrences that might happen outside of it.Such as, losing your contract or not being able to pay online.
			2)Being able for renters find other renters so they can pair up to find an owner that’s looking for multiple roommates. 
			And 3)it was sexy (minimal, appealing, and easy to use).
			</p>


		<h1> TEAM</h1>

			<p>Starting on the project we first wire framed how the flow of the application was going to be and then figured out what api’s to include that will assist in finding a solution for our problems.We priortize the importance of these API’s based on what we wanted our project to be and why.

		Parse: We needed to store information about the user somewhere and that will also allow us to build a login system. We  found Parse to be a perfect service for this because it allowed us to do what we wanted without a backend. * thumbs up*!

		Traitify:We needed a personality api that would test our users in a fun and easy way, that’s when we came across while searching across the internet we found Traitify. The problem while using stratify is that my team weren’t able to figure out how to implement the api into our website, but we’ll talk about that later on.----- The time we invested in it was paying to little compared to the amount of progress we made.With that being said we decided to drop this feature and implement it later on in the project or, the most likely option, in the future if we do decide to work on this project. ———

		cloudinary: We wanted our users to be able to implement images in their page and we didn’t want parse to become heavy with the images. so we needed a third party service that would allow to do this. Implementing this we needed grab a snippet from the documentation and apply it to our code. With that the snippet would make the button and it would return a url of the image that the user inputted in the website. what we learned to do is that at first se didn’t realized that the snippet gave us back that url. And using backbone.js and parse we didn’t know how to go and grab that url and send it to parse so that the url could be saved so that the url could give the images to us. so what we had the biggest problem was that within the snippet there was this default code that we needed to change into our account code that was unique to the culinary user and we needed to change the default code into our own. 

		Google Api: we wanted a feature that would allow for users to see how long it would take for them to go to work or any common place such as their mom’s house or favorite restaurant or place or baby daddy/mama house. While implementing these google maps api is that i wanted the google draw, google route , and google input addresses all in one. We had trouble mixing all these libraries in one so that it could create this one beauty of map that would be the Princess Peach to Mario. I’m Mario forever looking for ways to solve the obstacles that came across me and time was the anxious mom that was telling to hurry up and do some random chore, which was fix other code and implement this in this other area outside of this level. But for the sake of the demo project we create mock ups that would assimilate the flow of how the google maps would work.


		 stripe: For whatever reason the user can’t make the payment in person or just forgot to pay the owner last minute and you’re in the super market while this thought is happening. You can quickly have proof that you paid through the receipt which will be emailed to the user. 


		HelloSign: For those who lose things and can’t be able to find their contract online they have the opportunity to view their contracts online and have a safe heaven place for it .</p>

		<p>Being an all front-end team,it was difficult to incorporate the things that we wanted in the way that we wanted in three-weeks.Which, may sound like a lot, but we found ourselves begging fot more than 24 hours in a day in order to have something to present in demo day. So we had to create a mock-up for most of the project. </p>

		<h1>LEARNING</h1>
		<p>While doing this project I learned a lot when it comes to working as a team. My partner and I are both visual people and when it came to wanting something to work in a certain way or something looking at a certain way we came To fix this problem we both learned to talk things out into why it should be this way best fit for the user. For example, on our main page we didn’t know what color to use as the text on our front page becuase they were both good options. We had another classmate look at our choices and that helped make us make a decision based on what color to use. Another example would be when doing google maps, I had my flow different from the final project. I had the different google maps in stacks and Monica pointed out that it would be best for the user to have the maps disappear as the user would click on the button . I saw that it was even though I first initially thought that my way was the best.  Then there would be another way of helping out </p>


		<h1>TECHNICAL REPO / PRIORITY</h1>
		<p>For the technical priority we ordered it in the order that would make our MVP. So the most important thing would be the personality api because that was our own unique way of approaching this problem when it came to finding a roommate. Then there was the online contact, HelloSign which the people don’t have and stripe. Google maps to find out how long it’s going to take for you to go to the placed the user needs to do. These four features is what going to make our mvp .</p>
