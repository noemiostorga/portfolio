	    <h1>  CASE STUDY</h1>
          <p>Like many of us my partner, Monica, and I had come across a point in our lives where we had to find a roommate.Upon reminiscing on this experience, we realized we had a little voice on the back of our heads that made us wonder if we were going to develop a friendship with this stranger that we know little to nothing about. But somehow happens to work in the same area and possibly have a compatible personality that has the potential to turn into a close relationship.</p>

       <h1> PROBLEM/WHY?</h1>
        
        <p>The initial problem when looking for roommates is that it only allowed users to make superficial connections through their web app. Thus, making it difficult to assure people if they would really want to live with this person.Because of this, Monica and I decide to build EasyLiving. For those who want to build a deeper connection with people that they want to room with.</p>

         <p>Beside this concept, another problem with this kind of applications is that they have a poor user experience. The visual aspect of the application seems to be made in the early-mid 2000’s and it was basically a page filled with emails and a small description of the place.So my partner and I decided that when it came to creating this application that</p>
         <ol>
           <li> we wanted to make the annoyance meter for the user was at 0, whether it be while using the application or any occurrences that might happen outside of it.Such as, losing your contact is not being able to pay online.</li>
          <li>Being able for renters find other renters so they can pair up to find an owner that’s looking for multiple roommates. </li>
           <li> And 3)it was sexy (minimal, appealing, and easy to use).</li>
         </ol>


       <h1> TEAM</h1>

        <p>Starting on the project we first wire framed how the flow of the application was going to be and then figured out what API's to include that will assist in finding a solution for our problems.We prioritize the importance of these API’s based on what we wanted our project to be and why.</p>

        <p>Parse: We somehow needed to store information about the user that will also allow us to build a login system. We found Parse to be a perfect service for this because it allowed us to do what we wanted without a backend. * thumbs up*!</p>

        <p>Traitify: We needed a personality API that would test our users in a fun and easy way and that’s when we came across Traitify. We, unfortunately, decided to drop this feature for the future. The reason being is that the time we invested in trying to implement it to our website was paying too little compared to the amount of progress we made.</p> 

        <p>cloudinary: We wanted our users to be able to implement images in their page and we didn’t want Parse to become heavy with images. So we needed a third party service that would allow us to do this. What we learned that in order to do is, URL that the snippet gave had to be captured and sent to Parse.Using backbone.js and Parse we didn’t know how to go and grab that URL and send it to parse so that the URL could be saved so that the URL could give the images to us. So what we had the biggest problem was that within the snippet there was this default code that we needed to change into our account code that was unique to the culinary user and we needed to change the default code into our own. </p>

        <p>Google API: we wanted a feature that would allow users to see how long it would take for them to go to work or any common place such as their mom’s house or favorite restaurant or place or baby daddy/mama house. While implementing these google maps API is that I wanted the google draw, google route, and google input addresses all in one. We had trouble mixing all these libraries in one so that it could create this one beauty of map that would be the Princess Peach to Mario. I’m Mario forever looking for ways to solve the obstacles that came across me and time was the anxious mom that was telling to hurry up and do some random chore, which was fix other code and implement this in this other area outside of this level. But for the sake of the demo project we create mockups that would assimilate the flow of how the google maps would work.</p>


        <p> stripe: For whatever reason the user can’t make the payment in person or just forgot to pay the owner last minute and you’re in the supermarket while this thought is happening. You can quickly have proof that you paid through the receipt which will be emailed to the user. </p>

		<p>HelloSign: For those who lose things and can’t be able to find their contract online they have the opportunity to view their contracts online and have a safe heaven place for it.</p>

  		<p>Being an all front-end team, it was difficult to incorporate the things that we wanted in the way that we wanted in three weeks.Which may sound like a lot, but we found ourselves begging for more than 24 hours in a day in order to have something to present in the demo day. So we had to create a mock-up for most of the project. </p>

  		<h1>LEARNING</h1>
  		<p>While doing this project, I learned a lot when it comes to coding and working as a team. My partner and I are both visual people and when it came to wanting something to work in a certain way or something looking at a certain way we came to fix this problem we both learned to talk things out into why it should be this way best fit for the user. Overall, it was a great experience.</p>
